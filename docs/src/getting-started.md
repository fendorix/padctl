# Getting Started

## Install via Package Manager

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```sh
yay -S padctl-git
```

A prebuilt binary package (`padctl-bin`) is also available in the AUR.

### Debian / Ubuntu

```sh
curl -fLO https://github.com/BANANASJIM/padctl/releases/latest/download/padctl_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i padctl_amd64.deb
```

For arm64:

```sh
curl -fLO https://github.com/BANANASJIM/padctl/releases/latest/download/padctl_arm64.deb
sudo dpkg -i padctl_arm64.deb
```

## Prerequisites

- **Zig 0.15+** (build from source)
- **Linux kernel ≥ 5.10** (uinput + hidraw support)
- **libusb-1.0** (system package, optional — pass `-Dlibusb=false` to build without)
- A HID gamepad accessible via `/dev/hidraw*`

## Build from Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BANANASJIM/padctl
cd padctl
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

Optional build flags:

- `-Dlibusb=false` — disable libusb linkage (uses hidraw-only path)
- `-Dwasm=false` — disable WASM plugin runtime

> **GCC 15 build failure (issue #147):** Arch Linux and similar distros with **glibc 2.43+** may
> hit `error: relocation R_X86_64_PC64 in .sframe section is unsupported` — glibc 2.43 adds
> `.sframe` sections to `crt1.o` startup objects, which Zig 0.15.x's linker does not yet handle.
> This is an upstream Zig limitation, not a padctl bug. Use `Dockerfile.wave5` (Debian bookworm +
> Zig 0.15.2 tarball, glibc 2.36) or install Zig 0.15.2 from the
> [official tarball](https://ziglang.org/download/) on a system with glibc ≤ 2.41 (Debian 12,
> Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 all work; Arch with glibc 2.43+ does NOT).
> Upstream fix: [ziglang/zig#31272](https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/31272).

## Install

```sh
sudo ./zig-out/bin/padctl install
```

This copies the binary, systemd service, device configs, and udev rules into `/usr`. It also runs `systemctl daemon-reload` and `udevadm trigger` automatically, and removes any legacy udev rules left by previous installs.

Custom prefix (e.g. for packaging):

```sh
sudo ./zig-out/bin/padctl install --prefix /usr --destdir "$DESTDIR"
```

### Additional Services

`padctl install` also sets up the following on all systems:

- **`padctl-reconnect`** — A hotplug script triggered by udev when a controller is plugged in. It starts the daemon if not running, restarts it if failed, and re-applies the active mapping. After suspend/resume the kernel re-emits udev events for re-enumerated devices, so the same hook handles post-wake reconnect — no separate resume unit is needed.
- **Driver conflict rules** — Auto-generated udev rules that unbind conflicting kernel drivers (e.g., `xpad`) from devices that padctl manages. Configured per-device via `block_kernel_drivers` in device TOML configs. When run as root, `padctl install` also walks `/sys/bus/usb/drivers/<driver>/unbind` for matching VID:PID pairs immediately, so already-bound devices are evicted without waiting for replug (issue #162).

### Install a Mapping

To install a mapping config to `/etc/padctl/mappings/` during install:

```sh
sudo ./zig-out/bin/padctl install --mapping vader5
```

The `--mapping` flag is repeatable. Use `--force-mapping` to overwrite existing mapping files.

When `--mapping` is given, the installer also writes a device-to-mapping binding in `/etc/padctl/config.toml` so the daemon auto-applies the mapping on every boot. Use `--force-binding` to overwrite an existing binding for the same device.

> **Bazzite / immutable distros:** See the [Bazzite / Immutable Distros guide](immutable-install.md) for special installation steps.

> **Install problems?** See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for the `devices/` warning, systemd 257+ `status=218/CAPABILITIES`, and the Arch glibc 2.43 build failure.

## Verify

```sh
padctl scan
```

Lists all connected HID devices and shows whether a matching device config was found for each.

## Run as Service

If you built from source, run the installer first — `zig build` alone does **not** install the service file:

```sh
zig build
sudo ./zig-out/bin/padctl install    # installs binary, service, device configs, and udev rules
```

`padctl install` automatically runs `daemon-reload`, enables, and starts `padctl.service` via `sudo -u $SUDO_USER systemctl --user`. The `systemctl --user enable --now padctl.service` line is only needed if you used `--no-enable` or `--no-start`.

To auto-start at boot without an active login session (headless setups, Steam Deck game mode):

```sh
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

The service runs padctl in daemon mode, scanning all config directories (user, system, and builtin) with automatic hotplug support. udev rules grant access via `uaccess` — no `sudo` needed for the logged-in user.

Check the daemon is running:

```sh
$ padctl status
STATUS device=Flydigi Vader 5 Pro state=active mapping=fps
```

Each managed device prints one space-separated triple: `device=<name>`,
`state=<active|suspended>`, `mapping=<active mapping name|(none)>`. Multiple
devices appear on the same line. Exit code is 0 when the daemon answered
and 1 when the response begins with `ERR` or the socket is unreachable.

## Run Manually

Bare invocation — padctl auto-discovers configs via XDG paths:

```sh
padctl
```

Or target specific configs:

```sh
# Single config
padctl --config /usr/share/padctl/devices/sony/dualsense.toml

# All configs in a directory
padctl --config-dir /usr/share/padctl/devices/
```

## Validate a Config

```sh
padctl --validate devices/sony/dualsense.toml      # device config
padctl --validate ~/.config/padctl/mappings/fps.toml  # mapping config
```

`--validate` auto-detects which schema to apply by scanning for a `[device]`
section header — files containing `[device]`, `[device.*]`, or `[[device.*]]`
are validated as device configs; everything else (including bare `name = ...`
mapping files) is validated against the mapping schema.

Exit 0 = valid. Exit 1 = validation errors printed to stderr. Exit 2 = file not found or parse failure.

The flag is repeatable: `padctl --validate a.toml --validate b.toml` validates both files and exits with the worst code seen.

## Generate Device Docs

```sh
padctl --doc-gen --config devices/sony/dualsense.toml
```

## User Config

padctl reads a config file to set per-device default mappings. The loader checks these paths in order (first found wins):

1. `~/.config/padctl/config.toml` — user overrides (highest priority)
2. `/etc/padctl/config.toml` — system-wide defaults (written by `padctl install --mapping`)

```toml
version = 1

[[device]]
name = "Flydigi Vader 5 Pro"
default_mapping = "fps"
```

On daemon start, padctl matches the connected device name (case-insensitive) and loads the named mapping profile automatically. The system path is the fallback for environments where `HOME` is not set (e.g. systemd services).

`padctl switch <name>` automatically updates the user config, so the choice is remembered for bare `padctl switch` (re-apply without a name). Bare `padctl switch` (no argument) reads `default_mapping` from the connected device's entry in `config.toml`; if no entry exists, it prints `error: no default_mapping in config.toml for device "<name>"` and exits. To make the choice survive reboots, use `padctl switch <name> --persist` which copies the mapping and config to `/etc/padctl/` via sudo.

## CLI Reference

```sh
padctl switch [name] [--device <id>]       # switch mapping; omit name to fall back to default_mapping from config.toml
padctl switch <name> --persist             # switch + copy to /etc/padctl/ for reboot persistence (sudo)
padctl status [--socket <path>]            # show daemon status
padctl devices [--socket <path>]           # list connected devices
padctl list-mappings [--config-dir <dir>]  # list available mapping profiles
padctl reload [--pid <pid>]                # send SIGHUP to reload configs
padctl config list                         # show XDG config search paths
padctl config init [--device] [--preset <name>]  # interactive mapping creator; valid preset names: xbox-360, xbox-elite2, dualsense, switch-pro
padctl config edit [name]                  # open mapping in $VISUAL/$EDITOR
padctl config test [--config] [--mapping]  # live input preview
padctl dump enable|disable                 # toggle diagnostic logging (persists)
padctl dump status                         # show dump state, log path, size, time span
padctl dump export --period Nm|Nh|Nd [-o file]  # export filtered log window
padctl dump clear                          # delete all log files
```

See the [Diagnostic Logging guide](diagnostic-logging.md) for the full `padctl dump` workflow, log paths, and the `[diagnostics]` config section.

## udev Permissions

padctl needs access to `/dev/hidraw*`, `/dev/uinput`, and `/dev/uhid`. The first two are standard for HID gamepad daemons; `/dev/uhid` is required for the SDL3-visible IMU pairing path (per ADR-015) — `padctl install` writes the necessary udev rule (`60-padctl.rules`) and a `DeviceAllow=/dev/uhid rw` entry in the systemd unit automatically.

The `padctl install` command generates and installs udev rules automatically from device configs.

If you need to regenerate rules after adding custom device configs:

```sh
sudo padctl install
```

The udev rules use `TAG+="uaccess"` to grant the logged-in user access to supported devices without requiring root.
